    "text": "The dataset being analyzed in the final project is the Social Capital Atlas. This dataset comes from Data for Good at Meta (who is known to own Facebook and Instagram) and is organized into separated .csv files to analyze various US counties, zip codes, colleges, and high schools to measure three main measurements. Firstly, the economic connectedness measures the number of shared friends between people of different socioeconomic statuses. The second measure is the cohesiveness, and how much friends tend to be supported by other’s mutual friends. Finally, the civic engagem ent of each area is measured or the rate at which they volunteer.\n\n\nSource Link to Data: https://data.humdata.org/dataset/social-capital-atlas\n\n\n\nGrowing up, I noticed economic disparsity within my own hometown and how that played with relationship circles. I grew up in a sub-urban beach town called Ventura, about an hour away from Los Angeles county. It was generally a quiet town; however, I noticed some economic and racial disparsity, with certain communities being separated from the rest. I especially noticed this in friend groups within public high schools. Those who were more wealthy and lived in more expensive areas typically congregated together, while those who lived in less expensive areas were excluded from these groups and instead congregated amongst themselves. To my knowledge, most of the causes for exclusion were not from direct bullying but just difference in township sections (otherwise known as where people lived) and general community expectations.\nWhile I am unable to explore racial disparity in this dataset, I am able to see if this economic disparity affects friend groups through the country through this dataset. It will also be interesting to recognize whether higher rates of inclusion lead to higher rates of volunteer efforts, as it may assume a set of values within a community that truly sets it apart, or if it is all randomized.\n\n\n\n\nHow does the connectedness between individuals with varying socioeconomic statuses relate to the cohesiveness of friend groups?\nTo what extent does higher social cohesion in a society influence rates of civic engagement?"

While there are many columns, many of them will not be used for the final analysis since they are irrelevant to the research questions. Here is a summary of what columns this project will utilize, as well as explanation for why this project will not utilize the others.\nec_county - This measures the level of economic connectedness within a county. The equation for this is two times the share of high-SES (social economic status) friends amongst low-SES individuals and then averaged. This equation is from the research journal “Social capital I: Measurement and Associations with Economic Mobility.”  ec_high_county - This measures the connectedness between high-SES individuals solely, once again with a value that is averaged. The main difference is that this does not include how connected they are with people from lower economic statuses.  exposure_grp_mem_county - This measures how often high-SES individuals are exposed to low-SES individuals with the same formula of from ec_county.  exposure_grp_mem_high_county - This measures how often high-SES individuals are exposed to only high-SES individuals, once again measured with a similar formula.  clustering_county - This calculates the average fraction of an individual’s friend pairs who are also friends with each other including people only within the relevant county.  volunteering_rate_county - The percentage of Facebook users within a county that are predicted to be members of a volunteering or activism group. Secret groups or large groups that Facebook identified as “clearly misclassified” were not included in this calculation.   There are many other columns. One of the main categories include those that revolve around childhood connectedness specifically. These are not calculated because the research question aims to address all populations. Additionally, the two categories, the support_ratio_county, which measures the proportion of people who share a third mutual friend, and so was civic_organizations_county, which measures the number of Facebook Pages predicted to be “Public Good” within a county, are not included as they would not address the research questions effectively. As part of the cleaning process, these categories will be removed. The standard error colums will be kept, as they may need to be referred to in the conclusion.\n\n\nSummary Statistics\n\ncolumns_removed = ['num_below_p50', 'pop2018', 'child_ec_county', 'child_ec_se_county', 'ec_grp_mem_county', 'child_high_ec_county', 'child_high_ec_se_county', 'ec_grp_mem_high_county','child_exposure_county','child_high_exposure_county','bias_grp_mem_county','bias_grp_mem_high_county','child_bias_county','child_high_bias_county', 'support_ratio_county', 'civic_organizations_county']\n\ndf = df.drop(columns=columns_removed)\n\ncolumn_max = df.max()\ncolumn_min = df.min()\ncolumn_stats_df = pd.DataFrame({'Column': df.columns, 'Minimum': column_min, 'Maximum': column_max})\n\nprint(column_stats_df)\n\n                                                    Column  \\\ncounty                                              county   \ncounty_name                                    county_name   \nec_county                                        ec_county   \nec_se_county                                  ec_se_county   \nec_high_county                              ec_high_county   \nec_high_se_county                        ec_high_se_county   \nexposure_grp_mem_county            exposure_grp_mem_county   \nexposure_grp_mem_high_county  exposure_grp_mem_high_county   \nclustering_county                        clustering_county   \nvolunteering_rate_county          volunteering_rate_county   \n\n                                                Minimum                Maximum  \ncounty                                             1001                  56045  \ncounty_name                   Abbeville, South Carolina  Ziebach, South Dakota  \nec_county                                       0.29469                 1.3597  \nec_se_county                                    0.00436                0.05023  \nec_high_county                                  0.70062                1.71507  \nec_high_se_county                               0.00475                0.05099  \nexposure_grp_mem_county                          0.2552                1.48628  \nexposure_grp_mem_high_county                    0.51013                1.66616  \nclustering_county                               0.07162                0.26097  \nvolunteering_rate_county                        0.00965               0.308736  \n\n\nThis is the following cell range for each column:  ec_county - 0.29469 - 1.3597.

The standard deviation for this ranges from 0.004-0.05 per county, similar to the original ec_county statistic.  exposure_grp_mem_county - 0.2552-1.48628. The lower the number is, the less exposure people of high-SES to low-SES individuals.  exposure_grp_mem_high_county - 0.51013-1.66616. The lower the number is, the less exposure high-SES people have to other high-SES individuals.  clustering_county - 0.07162-0.26097. The lower the number equates to a lower amount of mutual friend circles within the county.  volunteering_rate_county - 0.00965 - 0.308736.

If so, what’s the pattern? Do those categories seem to have a balanced distribution, or are there more counties that are on the lower or higher end of the spectrum?      2) What do the levels of clustering_county, or fraction of friend_pairs, look like around the country? Is there any clear average?      3) What do the levels of volunteering rates look like around the country? Is there any clear average?   #### Data Exploration #1\n\ndf.plot.scatter(x='ec_county', y='ec_high_county')\nplt.xlabel(\"Economic Connectedness between low and high SES\")\nplt.ylabel(\"Connectedness within high SES\")\nplt.title(\"Relationship between Economic Connectedness of Low and High SES and Economic Connectedness within High SES\")\nplt.show()\n\n\n\n\nThis scatterplot aims to recognize if there’s any correlation between connectedness between low and high SES and just high SES individuals.   It seems there is a somewhat balanced, upward linear pattern between the two indicators. For the most part, the higher the economic connectedness between low and high SES indicates it’ll also be higher between those in just higher SES. There are some outliers, but none that indicate something incredibly wrong with the data. It tends to fall within the standard deviation predicted above. It is important to note that most of the outliers tend to fall with higher scores on the higher connectedness within just high-SES individuals, indicating that many counties do have a tendency to prioritize connectedness within one’s own social class rather than a variety. It’ll be interesting to see if this correlates with friendship circles as we get into the analysis.   While it looks like the economic connectedness is relatively evenly distributed country-wide, a histogram should be conducted to double check on the categories.  #### Data Exploration #2\n\nplt.figure(figsize=(12, 6))\n\nplt.subplot(1, 2, 1)  \nplt.hist(df['ec_county'], bins=10, range=(0.2, 1.4), edgecolor='black')\nplt.xlabel(\"Economic Connectedness per ec_county\")\nplt.ylabel(\"Frequency\")\nplt.title(\"Histogram of Economic Connectedness Between Low and High-SES\")\n\nplt.subplot(1, 2, 2)  \nplt.hist(df['ec_high_county'], bins=10, range=(0.7, 1.7), edgecolor='black')\nplt.xlabel(\"Economic Connectedness per ec_high_county\")\nplt.ylabel(\"Frequency\")\nplt.title(\"Histogram of Economic Connectedness for only High-SES\")\n\nplt.subplots_adjust(wspace=0.4)\nplt.show()\n\n\n\n\nThe original prediction of even distribution across the economic connectedness scores is incorrect.   The economic connectedness between low and high SES appears to be on somewhat a bell-curve, which means that there is higher frequency in the mid-range of the distribution with a score of around 0.8. This also happens to be the average or mean score. In simpler terms, this means that counties tend to have a moderate level of connectedness between people of different socioeconomic status.   On the other hand, the economic connectedness amongst only those of high-SES is slightly skewed to the higher range of the data. This means that those within the higher socioeconomic category tend to have stronger connections. This might also explain why in the scatterplot most of the deviations were indicated higher connectedness with only high-SES individuals.  #### Data Exploration #3\n\ndef extract_county_name(name): ## couldn't find a .geojson that had the counties lists as (County Name, State Name), like the dataset, hence the function\n    parts = name.split(',')\n    if len(parts) &gt; 1:\n        return parts[0].strip()  \n    else:\n        return name\n\ndf['county_name'] = df['county_name'].apply(extract_county_name)\n\nm = folium.Map(location=[36, -98], zoom_start=4)\n\ncounty_geo_url = \"https://eric.clst.org/assets/wiki/uploads/Stuff/gz_2010_us_050_00_20m.json\"\n\nfolium.Choropleth(\n    geo_data=county_geo_url,\n    data=df,\n    columns=['county_name', 'clustering_county'],\n    key_on='feature.properties.NAME',  \n    fill_color='YlGnBu',\n).add_to(m)\n\nm\n\n\nMake this Notebook Trusted to load map: File -&gt; Trust Notebook\n\n\nIn the main parts of the United States, most counties tend to be yellow or a ligher green, with some even getting into an aquamarine panel. Nevertheless, it’s important to note that the lighter green demonstrates relatively low clusters. Another histogram will be essential to confirm this.   As an interesting note, clusters are extremely frequent in Alaskan counties with many of the counties being aquamarine, medium blue, or dark blue. This might be because the population in Alaska is lower, so communities may be more tightly knit.  #### Data Exploration #4\n\ndf.hist(column='clustering_county')\nplt.xlabel(\"Frequency of Clusters / Mutual Connections within every County\")\nplt.ylabel(\"Frequency\")\nplt.title(\"Frequency of Relationship Cohesiveness within every County\")\nplt.show()\n\n\n\n\nAs predicted, clusters tend to be less frequent within each county, with the histogram heavily skewed to the left.\n\nData Exploration #5\n\nm = folium.Map(location=[36, -98], zoom_start=4)\n\ncounty_geo_url = \"https://eric.clst.org/assets/wiki/uploads/Stuff/gz_2010_us_050_00_20m.json\"\n\nfolium.Choropleth(\n    geo_data=county_geo_url,\n    data=df,\n    columns=['county_name', 'volunteering_rate_county'],\n    key_on='feature.properties.NAME',  \n    fill_color='YlOrRd',\n).add_to(m)\n\nm\n\n\nMake this Notebook Trusted to load map: File -&gt; Trust Notebook\n\n\nThis map seems to be more evenly distributed. Many of the states seem to be yellow to light orange, with a few noticeable ones in the reds. However, an important note is that the west (except for California) midwest, and northeast tend to have more counties in the orange range. Alaska and Hawaii entirely seem to be orange to dark orange as well.   This should also be confirmed with a histogram, but from this map it seems that the rate will be similarly skewed as the cluster and cohesiveness rate.  #### Data Visualization #6\n\ndf.hist(column='volunteering_rate_county')\nplt.xlabel(\"Frequency of Clusters / Mutual Connections within every County\")\nplt.ylabel(\"Frequency\")\nplt.title(\"Frequency of Relationship Cohesiveness within every County\")\nplt.show()\n\n\n\n\nThe above prediction was correct.\n\n\n\nData Cleaning\nAs a final step to the process, we will do some final data cleaning. There is no huge outlier, so worrying about that is no problem. However, as identified in the maps, there are some counties with no data. We will first identify whether there are any rows with missing values - if not, this would mean that the values did not correctly match up with the .geojson.\n\nmissing_values = df[df.isnull().any(axis=1)]\nprint(missing_values)\n\n      county         county_name  ec_county  ec_se_county  ec_high_county  \\\n52      1105               Perry        NaN           NaN             NaN   \n71      2060         Bristol Bay        NaN           NaN             NaN   \n82      2164  Lake and Peninsula        NaN           NaN             NaN   \n186     6003              Alpine        NaN           NaN             NaN   \n255     8023            Costilla        NaN           NaN             NaN   \n...      ...                 ...        ...           ...             ...   \n2707   48433           Stonewall        NaN           NaN             NaN   \n2713   48447        Throckmorton        NaN           NaN             NaN   \n2748   49009             Daggett        NaN           NaN             NaN   \n2759   49031               Piute        NaN           NaN             NaN   \n2831   51091            Highland        NaN           NaN             NaN   \n\n      ec_high_se_county  exposure_grp_mem_county  \\\n52                  NaN                      NaN   \n71                  NaN                      NaN   \n82                  NaN                      NaN   \n186                 NaN                      NaN   \n255                 NaN                      NaN   \n...                 ...                      ...   \n2707                NaN                      NaN   \n2713                NaN                      NaN   \n2748                NaN                      NaN   \n2759                NaN                      NaN   \n2831                NaN                      NaN   \n\n      exposure_grp_mem_high_county  clustering_county  \\\n52                             NaN           0.198011   \n71                             NaN           0.133101   \n82                             NaN           0.156810   \n186                            NaN           0.091637   \n255                            NaN           0.100376   \n...                            ...                ...   \n2707                           NaN           0.133058   \n2713                           NaN           0.105239   \n2748                           NaN           0.094783   \n2759                           NaN           0.123849   \n2831                           NaN           0.152162   \n\n      volunteering_rate_county  \n52                    0.031368  \n71                    0.042672  \n82                    0.086069  \n186                   0.146537  \n255                   0.062568  \n...                        ...  \n2707                  0.033803  \n2713                  0.244292  \n2748                  0.026229  \n2759                  0.030337  \n2831                  0.188111  \n\n[77 rows x 10 columns]\n\n\nWhile the ec_county is missing, none of the values are missing from clustering_county or volunteering_rate_county.

These seem to be the common errors. For example, Richmond County is just named Richmond.      1) Counties like “Richmond County” that have no city are simply just named “Richmond” in the dataset.
