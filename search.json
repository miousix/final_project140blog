    "text": "The dataset being analyzed in the final project is the Social Capital Atlas. This dataset comes from Data for Good at Meta (who is known to own Facebook and Instagram) and is organized into separated .csv files to analyze various US counties, zip codes, colleges, and high schools to measure three main measurements. Firstly, the economic connectedness measures the number of shared friends between people of different socioeconomic statuses. The second measure is the cohesiveness, and how much friends tend to be supported by other’s mutual friends. Finally, the civic engagem ent of each area is measured or the rate at which they volunteer.\n\n\nSource Link to Data: https://data.humdata.org/dataset/social-capital-atlas\n\n\n\nGrowing up, I noticed economic disparsity within my own hometown and how that played with relationship circles. I grew up in a sub-urban beach town called Ventura, about an hour away from Los Angeles county. It was generally a quiet town; however, I noticed some economic and racial disparsity, with certain communities being separated from the rest. I especially noticed this in friend groups within public high schools. Those who were more wealthy and lived in more expensive areas typically congregated together, while those who lived in less expensive areas were excluded from these groups and instead congregated amongst themselves. To my knowledge, most of the causes for exclusion were not from direct bullying but just difference in township sections (otherwise known as where people lived) and general community expectations.\nWhile I am unable to explore racial disparity in this dataset, I am able to see if this economic disparity affects friend groups through the country through this dataset. It will also be interesting to recognize whether higher rates of inclusion lead to higher rates of volunteer efforts, as it may assume a set of values within a community that truly sets it apart, or if it is all randomized.\n\n\n\n\nHow does the connectedness between individuals with varying socioeconomic statuses relate to the cohesiveness of friend groups?\nTo what extent does higher social cohesion in a society influence rates of civic engagement?"

Only data of users aged between 25-44, were on Facebook at least once in the prior 30 days, have at least 100 U.S. based Facebook friends, and having a non-missing ZIP codes were included in this report.

While there are many columns, many of them will not be used for the final analysis since they are irrelevant to the research questions. Here is a summary of what columns this project will utilize, as well as explanation for why this project will not utilize the others.\nec_county - This measures the level of economic connectedness within a county. The equation for this is two times the share of high-SES (social economic status) friends amongst low-SES individuals and then averaged. This equation is from the research journal “Social capital I: Measurement and Associations with Economic Mobility.”  ec_high_county - This measures the connectedness between high-SES individuals solely, once again with a value that is averaged. The main difference is that this does not include how connected they are with people from lower economic statuses.  exposure_grp_mem_county - This measures how often high-SES individuals are exposed to low-SES individuals with the same formula of from ec_county.  exposure_grp_mem_high_county - This measures how often high-SES individuals are exposed to only high-SES individuals, once again measured with a similar formula.  clustering_county - This calculates the average fraction of an individual’s friend pairs who are also friends with each other including people only within the relevant county.  volunteering_rate_county - The percentage of Facebook users within a county that are predicted to be members of a volunteering or activism group. Secret groups or large groups that Facebook identified as “clearly misclassified” were not included in this calculation.   There are many other columns. One of the main categories include those that revolve around childhood connectedness specifically. These are not included in this research report because the research question aims to address the adult population. Additionally, the two categories, the support_ratio_county, which measures the proportion of people who share a third mutual friend, and so was civic_organizations_county, which measures the number of Facebook Pages predicted to be “Public Good” within a county, are not included as they would not address the research questions effectively.

The lower the number is, the less connectedness there is between high-SES and low-SES individuals. The standard deviation ranges from around 0.004-0.05 per county.  ec_high_county - 0.70062 - 1.71507. The lower the number is, the less connectedness there is between high-SES individuals. The standard deviation for this ranges from 0.004-0.05 per county, similar to the original ec_county statistic.  exposure_grp_mem_county - 0.2552-1.48628. The lower the number is, the less exposure people of high-SES to low-SES individuals.  exposure_grp_mem_high_county - 0.51013-1.66616. The lower the number is, the less exposure high-SES people have to other high-SES individuals.  clustering_county - 0.07162-0.26097. The lower the number equates to a lower amount of mutual friend circles within the county.  volunteering_rate_county - 0.00965 - 0.308736. The lower the number is, the less volunteers the county has.  \nWe will also note the mean (average) values for future reference.\n\nmean_values = df.mean(numeric_only=True)\nprint(mean_values)\n\ncounty                          30218.783101\nec_county                           0.814464\nec_se_county                        0.013409\nec_high_county                      1.252636\nec_high_se_county                   0.014754\nexposure_grp_mem_county             0.906089\nexposure_grp_mem_high_county        1.078581\nclustering_county                   0.116456\nvolunteering_rate_county            0.078068\ndtype: float64"

Before addressing the question, we should identify and understand the dataset. To help with this process the following section will go through data exploration. Essentially, we will create some visualizations to recognize any anomalies, patterns, and any further information that might need cleaning.\nFor this dataset that is entirely numerical and based on location, the best visualization methods to explore this dataset will be through scatterplots, histograms, and heat maps. These also happen to be the best type of visualizations to do further analysis, however, we will look specifically into the following questions before investigating further.       1) Is there any relationship between economic connectedness between low and high SES and just high SES? If so, what’s the pattern? Do those categories     seem to have a balanced distribution, or are there more counties that are on the lower or higher end of the spectrum?      2) What do the levels of clustering_county, or fractions of friend pairs, look like around the country? Is there any clear average?      3) What do the levels of volunteering rates look like around the country? Is there any clear average?   After we have a better understanding of what this looks like, we will then investigate more into the research questions. This will involve creating visualizations that explore more of the direct connection between these three factors of connectedness, cohesiveness, and civic engagement, rather than focusing on each factor individually as we did in the exploration stage. Then, we can move onto our discussion and analyze how this connects with the research question."

It seems there is a somewhat balanced, upward linear pattern between the two indicators. For the most part, the higher the economic connectedness between low and high SES indicates it’ll also be higher between those in just higher SES. Although a few outliers are present, they do not strongly deviate from the overall trend of the data, generally aligning with the previously predicted standard deviation.\nIt is important to note that the majority of outliers predominantly cluster towards the upper end of the high-SES connectedness spectrum. This could imply that many counties have a tendency to prioritize connectedness within one’s own social class rather than a diverse connections. It’ll be interesting to see if this correlates with friendship circles as we get into the analysis.   While the scatterplot indicates a relatively even distribution of economic connectedness country-wide, a histogram should be conducted to double check on the categories.  ### Data Exploration #2\n\nplt.figure(figsize=(12, 6))\n\nplt.subplot(1, 2, 1)  \nplt.hist(df['ec_county'], bins=10, range=(0.2, 1.4), edgecolor='black')\nplt.xlabel(\"Economic Connectedness per ec_county\")\nplt.ylabel(\"Frequency\")\nplt.title(\"Histogram of Economic Connectedness Between Low and High-SES\")\n\nplt.subplot(1, 2, 2)  \nplt.hist(df['ec_high_county'], bins=10, range=(0.7, 1.7), edgecolor='black')\nplt.xlabel(\"Economic Connectedness per ec_high_county\")\nplt.ylabel(\"Frequency\")\nplt.title(\"Histogram of Economic Connectedness for only High-SES\")\n\nplt.subplots_adjust(wspace=0.4)\nplt.show()\n\n\n\n\nThe original prediction of even distribution across the economic connectedness scores is incorrect.   The economic connectedness between low and high SES appears to be on somewhat a bell-curve, which means that there is higher frequency in the mid-range of the distribution with a score of around 0.8. This also happens to be the average or mean score. In simpler terms, this means that counties tend to have a moderate level of connectedness between people of different socioeconomic status, and fewer ones have either high levels or low levels.   On the other hand, the economic connectedness amongst only those of high-SES is slightly skewed to the higher range of the data. This means that those within the higher socioeconomic category tend to have stronger connections. This might also explain why in the scatterplot most of the deviations were indicated higher connectedness with only high-SES individuals.   Now that the first question is fully addressed, we will now analyze the clustering rates around the country. ### Data Exploration #3\n\ndef extract_county_name(name): ## couldn't find a .geojson that had the counties lists as (County Name, State Name), like the dataset, hence the function\n    parts = name.split(',')\n    if len(parts) &gt; 1:\n        return parts[0].strip()  \n    else:\n        return name\n    \ndf['county_name'] = df['county_name'].apply(extract_county_name)\ncounty_geo_url = \"https://eric.clst.org/assets/wiki/uploads/Stuff/gz_2010_us_050_00_20m.json\"\n\n\nm = folium.Map(location=[36, -98], zoom_start=3)\n\n\ntitle_html = '''\n&lt;h1 align=\"center\" style=\"font-size:18px\"&gt;&lt;b&gt;Cohesiveness Rates around the Country&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;\n&lt;p align=\"center\"&gt;Cohesiveness is calculated through data regarding clustering_county.&lt;/p&gt;\n'''\n\nm.get_root().html.add_child(folium.Element(title_html))\nfolium.Choropleth(\n    geo_data=county_geo_url,\n    data=df,\n    columns=['county_name', 'clustering_county'],\n    key_on='feature.properties.NAME',  \n    fill_color='Spectral',\n).add_to(m)\n\nm\n\n\nMake this Notebook Trusted to load map: File -&gt; Trust Notebook\n\n\nBefore analyzing this dataset, it is clear that some counties are missing as they are colored in black.

Here are some reasons why they do not match up.      1) Counties like “Richmond County” that have no city are simply just named “Richmond” in the .geojson. Differentiating between a city and county is not indicated in the name of the geojson.      2) Some versions of the spelling of a county, such as Ste Genevieve have periods in different placements. It may simply also just be messed up due to odd encoding (e.g. DoÃ83Â±a Ana was supposed to be Doña Ana).   We will fix all of these through a name mapping process, and then verify to make sure we do not have any more missing names.\n\nname_mapping = {\n    \"0500000US51161\": {\"NAME\": \"Roanoke County\"},\n    \"0500000US51770\": {\"NAME\": \"Roanoke City\"},\n    \"0500000US24510\": {\"NAME\": \"Baltimore City\"},\n    \"0500000US29189\": {\"NAME\": \"St. Louis County\"},\n    \"0500000US51059\": {\"NAME\": \"Fairfax County\"},\n    \"0500000US24005\": {\"NAME\": \"Baltimore County\"},\n    \"0500000US51019\": {\"NAME\": \"Bedford County\"},\n    \"0500000US35013\": {\"NAME\": \"DoÃ\\x83Â±a Ana\"},\n    \"0500000US51159\": {\"NAME\": \"Richmond County\"},\n    \"0500000US51760\": {\"NAME\": \"Richmond City\"},\n    \"0500000US29510\": {\"NAME\": \"St. Louis City\"},\n    \"0500000US29186\": {\"NAME\": \"Ste Genevieve\"},\n    \"0500000US51067\": {\"NAME\": \"Franklin County\"},\n}\n\ndef update_geojson_feature_properties(feature, properties):\n    feature['properties'].update(properties)\n\nfor feature in county_geo_data['features']:\n    census_area = feature['properties'].get('GEO_ID', '')\n    if census_area in name_mapping:\n        update_geojson_feature_properties(feature, name_mapping[census_area])\n\ngeojson_names = set(feature['properties']['NAME'] for feature in county_geo_data['features'])\ndf_names = set(df['county_name'])\nmissing_names = df_names - geojson_names\n\nif missing_names:\n    print(\"Missing county names:\", missing_names)\nelse:\n    print(\"There are no more missing county names.\")\n\nThere are no more missing county names.\n\n\nWith all county names accounted for, we can now proceed with our map analysis.

Light green hues, though scarce, tend to appear mostly in the southwest and midwest regions. This analysis suggests that the rate of cohesiveness throughout the country is quite low, but another histogram will be essential to confirm this.   Notably, the higher frequencies of cohesiveness only occur in Alaska. Initially, one might assume this might have correlation with population, especially when comparing this map to a map from the World Population Review, it happens to be in their less populated census areas that cohesiveness is most frequent. However, Nome Census Area, which is one of the few areas (Alaska has no counties) highlighted in blue, has a population of 9,825.¹ McMullen County in Texas, one of the smallest counties in the United States, has a population of only 576 as of 2022² yet is still colored orange, meaning its cohesiveness score is still quite low. Evidently, population alone does not effect cohesiveness, although it could play a small role.   Additionally, a significant portion of California is highlighted in red, meaning its cohesiveness is quite low.

Nonetheless, this means that there is relatively low volunteering rates. An important note is that the west (except for California), midwest, and northeast tend to have more counties that average in the orange range. No state seems to particularly show higher rates of volunteering than average except for Alaska.   This should also be confirmed with a histogram, but from this map it seems that the rate will be similarly skewed as the histogram for cohesiveness rate.  ### Data Visualization #6\n\ndf.hist(column='volunteering_rate_county')\nplt.xlabel(\"Frequency of Clusters / Mutual Connections within every County\")\nplt.ylabel(\"Frequency\")\nplt.title(\"Frequency of Relationship Cohesiveness within every County\")\nplt.show()\n\n\n\n\nThe assumption made above is confirmed.

    "text": "Explanatory Stage\nFollowing the initial assessment of the data, it is likely that connectedness does not correlate to cohesiveness. Cohesiveness around the country seems to be heavily skewed, while connectedness is more balanced. It is also worth investigating whether exposure to low SES and high SES individuals increases connectedness. Such a finding would suggest that connectedness is primarily influenced by exposure rather than being solely a matter of cultural emphasis.\nHowever, higher social cohesion does likely lead to higher rates of civic engagement. This is because it builds more of a community, and as we seen in areas like Alaska, both rates of cohesion and civic engagement tend to be higher.\nTo begin, let’s first see if there’s any relationship between exposure and connectedness."

Counties that experience greater exposure to diverse socioeconomic groups tend to exhibit higher levels of connectedness. There are some outliers that mostly consist of points that have higher exposure but lower connectedness than usual. This finding is a key finding as it suggests connectedness is predominantly influenced by the extent of exposure, rather than being rooted primarily in a county’s culture influences. Otherwise, there would be much less of a linear correlation and more frequent outliers.\nThis finding further decreases the likelihood of a correlation between cohesiveness and connectedness. Cohesiveness is the degree of a social network’s cliques and the integration of mutual friends, which is a decision that people make by choice. Exposure is not a choice, people are naturally prone to it simply by moving into a certain county. These distinct motivational factors make it less probable for a causal relationship to exist between the two."

Many outliers are on the lower than average side of connectedness, but higher than average levels of cohesion or the converse. A significant proportion of these cases demonstrate lower cohesiveness levels along the economic connectedness spectrum. This suggests that there is little relation; however, certain counties with cultures of economic hierarchy may be higher. We will identify whether this statement could be valid by conducting another scatterplot that measures the connectedness exclusively between those of high SES instead."

While it does start to establish a slightly more linear trend than above, it is not significant enough to say there is any correlation. Additionally, many of the outliers have the same pattern of having low connectedness but high cohesion and conversely, so it disproves the economic hierachy theory.\nWith this, the economic hierarchy theory loses support.

There is no linear pattern present and most of the points are near the lower left quadrant of the graph. This would mean that increased cohesiveness does not increase civic engagement by any means. In fact many of the outliers seem to be on opposite ends of the spectrum, meaning that cohesiveness is high but civic engagement is low, or civic engagement is low but cohesiveness is high.\nWe will do a final analysis of this point in a heatmap to potentially uncover clusters or trends that warrant further scrutiny and discussion for this point."

    "section": "Interpretation",
    "text": "Interpretation\nThe outcome of the analysis did not meet the initial expectations for certain points. While it was expected that connectedness and cohesiveness would not be correlated due to their distinct motivational drivers, it was expected that cohesiveness and civic engagement would have a connection as they are voluntarily performed actions.\nOne plausible reason that might explain the connectedness and cohesiveness is that race might play a more significant role in this scenario. In a intercultural research study conducted in the Netherlands, researchers found that wealthy Dutch individuals had a stronger preference for friendships that had cultural similarities; therefore, they had fewer interethnic friendships. Higher SES non-Western minority members on the other hand, craved more interethnic friendships.³ This resonates with observations within the United States, as there is often a racial divide for socioeconomic classes within neighborhoods. An example of this is in Ventura as mentioned in the beginning of the report. A research report identified that a greater percentage of minorities, such as Hispanic/Latino, African American, and Asian members, lived in areas where there was toxicity-weighted pesticide use.⁴\nRegarding cohesiveness and civic engagement, the absence of a direct relationship could stem from cohesiveness primarily measuring the existence and inclusion within social cliques, without delving into the depth of relationships or social dynamics. When investigating civic engagement, researchers found that when people felt a stronger connection and relationship to their neighborhood, they were more likely to desire wanting to participate in volunteer work.⁵ Cohesiveness does not include only strong relationships, if it did, this would likely result in different results.\nAn intriguing exception was Alaska as it was the only region where there was stronger rates in cohesiveness and civic engagement throughout a majority of its counties. The Foraker Group, a non-profit organization in Anchorage, Alaska proudly presents that it is 5th in the nation for volunteerism.⁶ Considering they have the third to least population in the United States, this is significant.⁷ Nearly half of Alaskan residents donate to charity, and they estimate about a third of adults serve as board members for a nonprofit. While it is harder to find secondary literature that connects their cohesiveness, this explains why their civic engagement rates are particularly higher than most other states. Considering a lot of their population participates, there might be a higher emphasis on community within the state’s culture, hence the higher rates."

For starters, research articles have previously recognized socioeconomic segregation in friendship networks, romantic partners, neighborhoods, education, and workplaces.⁸ Yet, through this study, it is suggested that the divide depends on other factors such as race and cultural differences. This is crucial when addressing the incessant wealth gap within American society.\nAdditionally, to increase civic engagement in society, the fostering of a strong community is needed. Since there is no correlation between cohesiveness and civic engagement, a strong community is not one in which many people are connected and involved, rather, it is one that can establish a powerful identity and inspire others to become a part of it. A common phenmonen and experience in many people’s lives is to meet and network with as many people as one can, but this report proves that not might always be the case for personal growth and might be more superficial."

Relying on Facebook data has its constraints, as it may not fully capture the strength of relationships or accurately represent offline engagement. Additionally, civil engagement is measured by the existence of Facebook groups, while it is likely that many users do not establish their membership of volunteer groups online. Many users might also befriend users that they know of but are not quite connected to on a platform like Facebook simply because they like the numbers. Hence, reports may be skewed for results of civic engagement and connectedness. Combining self-reported data with Facebook-derived data could offer a more comprehensive perspective."
